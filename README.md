# Simple Interest Calculator

A simple calculator that computes **Simple Interest** given the principal, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Formula
\[
\text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
\]

Where:
- `P` = Principal amount  
- `R` = Annual rate of interest (in %)  
- `T` = Time period (in years)  

## Input
- `p`: Principal amount  
- `t`: Time period in years  
- `r`: Annual rate of interest  

## Output
- `simple interest = p * t * r`
